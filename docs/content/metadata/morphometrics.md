# Morphometrics Dataset

The `morphometrics.csv` file contains morphological measurements for birds captured and retrapped in a study area. The dataset includes information on species, age, sex, weight, and various body measurements.

## File Format

The CSV file has no index column, and the first row contains the column names. The column names provide descriptive labels for each variable in the dataset.
